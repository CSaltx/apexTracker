### Introduction
If you have played games, you have probably wanted a place to see all your statistics. The goal of this project is to learn up more about HTML, JavaScript, and Flask while providing a useful website for video game enthusiasts.


### Information
There are 3 web pages in this project. One page is an about page that emulates the view of a terminal screen with interactive functionality. The main page, found through the "Enter" button allows you to type in an input and leaves you with data regarding the player entered or an error if such an error occured. I hope in future iterations of this project to integrate React functionality so the pages refresh on command and are faster.


### Documentation
In the static folder, you can find the images, fonts, and css used to make the webpages. In the about page, you can see an animation created using CSS whose source code can be found here. In the templates folder, you can find the HTML webpages. In the main src folder, you can find the apex tracker file which connects the webpages and retrieves data from the tracker.gg API using Python and the Flask Framework.

### Technologies
